A tutorial on scalable system simulations for RISC-V architectures and performance analysis for machine learning workloads
==========================================================================================================================
This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to computer system simulations
and performance analysis, focusing on the integration and application of consensual open-source frameworks
like Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST), Gem5, and Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR).
Participants will gain hands-on experience in conducting an architectural design exploration with a pragmatic approach
where the simulation framework used is chosen based on a trade-off between fidelity and scalability requirements. By the end of the tutorial, participants will be equipped with the skills necessary to conduct in-depth performance analysis and optimize complex systems using state-of-the-art tools.
